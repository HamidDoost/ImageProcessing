# basic-image-procesing-cocepts

This repository contains useful codes written in Python for  basic image processing. Examples of these codes are Saliancy Detection, Corners Detection, simple Remove Background, Resizing, Translating images, and Super Pixel Keypoints.

I will add other useful basic image processing concepts gradually here. These codes can be used as separate codes for image processing or as a preprocessing stage for a larger process such as computer vision techniques or ML or Deep Learning.

The authors Dr. Hamid Doostmohammadi and Dr. Azadeh Nazemi hope that you enjoy these codes.
